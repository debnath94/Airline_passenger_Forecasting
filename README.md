LSTM stands for Long short-term memory. LSTM cells are used in recurrent neural networks that learn to predict the future from sequences of variable lengths. Note that recurrent neural networks work with any kind of sequential data and, unlike ARIMA and Prophet, are not restricted to time series. 

Designing an optimal LSTM based model can be a difficult task that requires careful hyperparameter tuning.

For training the deep learning model we need more data
